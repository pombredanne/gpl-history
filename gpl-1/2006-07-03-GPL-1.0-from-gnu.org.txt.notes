Notes: When the GNU website was revamped after the introduction of GPL-3.0
    the GPL-1.0 was also included in the list of old licenses. This might
    actually be the first time that the license actually was on the GNU website.
    Note that the address in the license is the address FSF moved to in 2005,
    but the license is from 1989.
