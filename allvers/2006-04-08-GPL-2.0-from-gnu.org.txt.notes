Notes: This is slightly different when compared with the "graveyard" version:
    - no Inc., but Inc. (preamble)
    - no USA. but USA (appendix)
    It is basically the same as 5.1 but with Library -> Lesser
    This is ONLY on gnu.org and is older than 5.1 which is only on fsf.org.
    And older than 5.2
    "Library" to "Lesser" in appendix and preamble  only on gnu.org
