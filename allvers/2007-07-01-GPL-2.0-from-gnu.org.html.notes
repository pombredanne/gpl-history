Notes: 
 In this version the only changes is the HTML formatting when compared to the
 previous HTML version from gnu.org 
 Shortly after the publication of the GPL 3.0, the good ole GPL 2.0
 was retired to the old licenses cemetery in the "old-licenses" dir.
 And along the GPL 2 HTML received a cosmetic touchup.
