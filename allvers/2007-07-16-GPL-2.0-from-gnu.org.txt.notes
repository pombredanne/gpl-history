Notes: This is mostly final version of the GPL 2 aka. the "graveyard" version.
 Shortly after the publication of the GPL 3.0, the good ole GPL 2.0
 was retired to the old licenses cemetery in the "old-licenses" directory.
 And along the way the GPL 2 received a cosmetic touchup with punctuation and
 formatting fixes.
