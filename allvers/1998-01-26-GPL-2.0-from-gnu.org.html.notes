Notes: It has several small changes from v2. Beside the HTML formatting,
 - The TERMS and CONDITIONS does not mention:
   "GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE"
 - "Appendix" is not mentioned at the start of the Appendix
 Therefore, the header is like in COPYING.2 and the missing "Appendix: "
 is like in COPYING.3, hence why this was christened as a v2.5
