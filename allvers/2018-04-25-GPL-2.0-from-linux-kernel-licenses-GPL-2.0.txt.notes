Add GPL-2.0-only/or-later as valid identifiers

This version results from an existential debate between the FSF and SPDX
where SPDX accepted to rename GPL-2.0 and GPL-2.0+ license ids to
GPL-2.0-only and GPL-2.0-or-later respectively (and same for other FSF
licenses) creating havoc in the kernel community and everywhere where
using SPDX ids was starting to take off. The kernel followed suite
kindly though to set a good example.
