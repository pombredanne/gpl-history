Notes: The key change is the addition of the GPL 2.0 only statement:
 This version date is not clear but is seen here and predates v2.4.11
 Also note that the only valid version of the GPL as far as the kernel
 is concerned is _this_ license (ie v2), unless explicitly otherwise
 stated.
 Per https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel_version_history
 this commit must predate v2.4.11 and come after 2.2
    2.2    26 January 1999
    2.4     4 January 2001
 Not in 2.2, not in any 2.3 but present in 2.4.0
